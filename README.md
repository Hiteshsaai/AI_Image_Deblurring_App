# Image Deblurring ML App

## Introduction

It is a Deep learning model whichi is used to convert a blurred image to a clear high resolution image.
We have used SRCNN deep learning architecture. This architecure has a base of CNN network.

## Purpose 

The main purpose of this application is to convert the blurred image in to a high resolution picture. In this fast running world, if we see something exciting or on a vacation trip we end up cliking n number of images. There is a higher probability of having some images to be in out of focus/blurred. We dont need to go back to the same location to capture the image again some times it even might not be possible. So in those cases, we can just use this application to process those blurred images to convert it in to better/higher resolution image with no blur to the image.
